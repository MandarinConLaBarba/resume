      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        I'm a software engineer with broad experience in various platforms and environments, and a
        strong believer in transparency and the "fail-fast" culture/mentality.
        I try to spend my time as efficiently as possible, and I'm always on the lookout for ways to improve productivity.
        I enjoy trying new things and sharing what I know with others.
        I consider my my development "instincts" and efficiency to be my greatest asset.

      </p>
      <p>
        The last few years I've been riding the JavaScript wave. I find the JavaScript ecosystem exciting and dynamic, but I'm also interested
        in other areas.
